I will use an object-oriented approach.
First, what will be the concept I try to abstract as a class?

A Virtual chef, aka Chefbot.
Use an agent-based systems approach to model the thing.
So...
An Agent is situated in an Environment.
Here, the environment is just streams of input text from the user, and output text from the Chefbot itself.

We need a Perception system.
The Chefbot should be able to "See", then take "Action" when it sees.
The "see" function is the Chefbot's ability to observe its environment.
The "action" function represents the Chefbot's decision-making process.
The output of "see" is a Percept?
An internal data structure is used to record information about the environment state and history.
This will represent all Internal states.

    see: Environment ----> Percept

A percept is just what the agent "senses"/"perceives".

    action: Percept ----> Actions
    action: InternalState ----> Actions

Next function:
Maps (Internal State, Perception) to Internal State.
