OUTPUT VALIDATOR
    This validates the output, ensuring that the output is relevant
to the prompt. How to handle output validation?
Not sure yet, but for now I'll just use LlamaAI to generate a score.
'Is the response related to cooking?' and 'How relevant is the response to the prompt'?
'Is the response harmful/offensive?'
Depending on the score, the response will be ranked valid or invalid.
For now, will just treat all responses as valid.
