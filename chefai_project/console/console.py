CONSOLE
    This class handles the behaviour of the application itself.
Yes, it's a god class but at this point I have too many classes to keep track of.
The first version of ChefAI is a command-line application.
Console should handle startup (including flags if any), help (documentation), runtime behaviour such as...
    Clearing the screen
    Changing the interface
    Interactive dialogue
    Loading or exiting chats
as well as persistency (saving chats to memory), and exit/cleanup behaviour.
